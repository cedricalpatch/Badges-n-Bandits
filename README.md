# Badges n' Bandits (BNB)
A Cops and Robbers Gamemode for [RedM](https://redm.gg/)
The current version is 0.1d (DEV)

## Description
RedM BNB is a community-developed gamemode for RedM, a modification of Red Dead Redemption 2. In this non-roleplay oriented gamemode, players join, make their character, and spend time either completing legal jobs (mail courier, fishing, etc), illegal jobs (robbery, gun running, etc), or taking the role of law enforcement.

## Weekly Update
The master branch will be updated on a weekly basis every Thursday evening at 1PM Pacific (4PM Eastern).
If the dev build is stable, it will be pushed to the master and all changes will be effective immediately.
If the dev build is not stable, critical branches/changes will be rebased into the master.

# Development Instructions

- Each commit needs a brief but detailed description of the contribution
- Pull Requests must either be working code, or marked with a README.md of the current production status

## Forking & Pull Requests
All working copies will be on the dev branch. Anyone wishing to contribute should fork the dev branch of the gamemode, create any branches as necessary, and open a pull request when finished.
