# Badges n' Bandits (BNB)
### Introduction
A Cops and Robbers Gamemode for [RedM](https://redm.gg/)

### Game Version
The current version is 0.1d (DEV)

## Description
RedM BNB is a community-developed gamemode for RedM, a modification of Red Dead Redemption 2. In this non-roleplay oriented gamemode, players join, make their character, and spend time either completing legal jobs (mail courier, fishing, etc), illegal jobs (robbery, gun running, etc), or taking the role of law enforcement.

## Weekly Update
The master branch will be updated on a weekly basis every Thursday evening at 1PM Pacific (4PM Eastern).
If the dev build is stable, it will be pushed to the master and all changes will be effective immediately.
If the dev build is not stable, critical branches/changes will be rebased into the master.

## Forking & Pull Requests
All working copies will be on the dev branch. Anyone wishing to contribute should fork the dev branch of the gamemode, create any branches as necessary, and open a pull request when finished.

### Unfinished Pull Requests
If your done working on your contribution for a decent part of time, submit your work to the repo and come back later to finish it. We'd rather allow others to have access to your changes and work on it in the mean time.

### Conflicts
All merge conflicts must be resolved before finalizing your pull request.
Requests with conflicts will not be accepted.
